## Introduction

Are you tired of vanilla food, but food mods add way too many crops? Or simply want a couple of foods for roleplay? Well, this mod is for you! Introducing Foods Reimagined where the goal is to add simple, balanced, and easy foods.

## Food Categories

For the sake of simplicity, all food has been divided into the following categories. This makes it easier to tell how good food is and what it does. (All saturation and hunger values are out of 20)

 - Drinks
    - 1 hunger and 0 saturation
    - Unique effects similar to potions
 - Snack
    - 4 hunger and 5 saturation. 
 - Breakfast
    - 7 hunger and 9 saturation
    - Speed I for 2:00
 - Lunch
    - 10 hunger 14 saturation
 - Dinner
    - 14 hunger 12 saturation
    - Slowness I for 0:20
 - Desert
    - 4 hunger 3 saturation
    - Speed I and Haste I for 2:00
    - Afterwards, a sugar crash: Slowness I and Mining Fatigue I for 1:00
